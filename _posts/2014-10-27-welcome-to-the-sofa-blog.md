A few weeks ago [Christoph](http://twitter.com/cburgdorf) wrote about our [open source mission](http://blog.couchcommerce.com/2014/10/13/its-called-open-source/) with the sofa project at [CouchCommerce](http://couchcommerce.com). In order to keep the development of sofa not only open source, but also as transparent as possible, we created this blog to keep you up-to-date with the latest releases, as well as cool things happening in the community.

To get started building full-featured e-commerce web apps with sofa, go and checkout out our [open sourced application](https://github.com/sofa/app) we published a few weeks ago. In addition we have a first version of our [API documentation](http://www.sofa.io/docs/#!/api) online, so you can read about the provided components and its APIs. The documentation is generated automatically from our source code, which means it gets updated together with new sofa releases.

Last but not least we ran a [webinar](http://blog.couchcommerce.com/2014/08/25/webinar-get-started-with-sofa-the-e-commerce-web-app-sdk/) where we talked about the first steps to get started with sofa, so make sure to check that one out too!

We'd love to hear about your sofa-driven apps you're working on, so drop us a line on Twitter at [@sofa_io](http://twitter.com/sofa_io)!
